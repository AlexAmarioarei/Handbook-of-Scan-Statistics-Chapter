  abstract    = {BACKGROUND: The spatial scan statistic proposed by Kulldorff has been applied to a wide variety of epidemiological studies for cluster detection. This scan statistic, however, uses a circular window to define the potential cluster areas and thus has difficulty in correctly detecting actual noncircular clusters. A recent proposal by Duczmal and Assuncao for detecting noncircular clusters is shown to detect a cluster of very irregular shape that is much larger than the true cluster in our experiences. METHODS: We propose a flexibly shaped spatial scan statistic that can detect irregular shaped clusters within relatively small neighborhoods of each region. The performance of the proposed spatial scan statistic is compared to that of Kulldorff's circular spatial scan statistic with Monte Carlo simulation by considering several circular and noncircular hot-spot cluster models. For comparison, we also propose a new bivariate power distribution classified by the number of regions detected as the most likely cluster and the number of hot-spot regions included in the most likely cluster. RESULTS: The circular spatial scan statistics shows a high level of accuracy in detecting circular clusters exactly. The proposed spatial scan statistic is shown to have good usual powers plus the ability to detect the noncircular hot-spot clusters more accurately than the circular one. CONCLUSION: The proposed spatial scan statistic is shown to work well for small to moderate cluster size, up to say 30. For larger cluster sizes, the method is not practically feasible and a more efficient algorithm is needed.},

  abstract      = {The multivariate Bayesian scan statistic (MBSS) is a recently proposed, general framework for event detection and characterization in multivariate space-time data. MBSS integrates prior information and observations from multiple data streams in a Bayesian framework, computing the posterior probability of each type of event in each space-time region. MBSS has been shown to have many advantages over previous event detection approaches, including improved timeliness and accuracy of detection, easy interpretation and visualization of results, and the ability to model and accurately differentiate between multiple event types. This work extends the MBSS framework to enable detection and visualization of irregularly shaped clusters in multivariate data, by defining a hierarchical prior over all subsets of locations. While a naive search over the exponentially many subsets would be computationally infeasible, we demonstrate that the total posterior probability that each location has been affected can be efficiently computed, enabling rapid detection and visualization of irregular clusters. We compare the run time and detection power of this 'Fast Subset Sums' method to our original MBSS approach (assuming a uniform prior over circular regions) on semi-synthetic outbreaks injected into real-world Emergency Department data from Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. We demonstrate substantial improvements in spatial accuracy and timeliness of detection, while maintaining the scalability and fast run time of the original MBSS method.},

Scan statistics are mostly used for count data, such as disease incidence or mortality. Sometimes there is an interest in looking for clusters with respect to a continuous variable, such as lead levels in children or low birth weight. For such continuous data, we present a scan statistic where the likelihood is calculated using the the normal probability model. It may also be used for other distributions, while still maintaining the correct alpha level. In an application of the new method, we look for geographical clusters of low birth weight in New York City.},
