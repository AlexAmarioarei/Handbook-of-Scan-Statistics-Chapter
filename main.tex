\begin{abstract}
The definition of the the two-dimensional discrete scan statistic with rectangular window shape is extended to a more general framework in which the scanning window is constructed based on a score function. In particular, this approach allows to introduce different shapes for the scanning window (discretized rectangle, polygon, circle, ellipse or annulus). We provide approximation for the distribution of the scan statistic and illustrate their accuracy by conducting a numerical comparison study. The power of test based on the scan statistics is also evaluated by simulation.

\section{Introduction}

Let $T_1, T_2\geq 2$ be positive integers and consider the two dimensional rectangular region, $\mathcal{R}_2$, defined by $\mathcal{R}_2 = [0,T_1]\times[0,T_2]$. For each $1\leq s_j\leq T_j$, $j\in\{1,2\}$, one can associate to the elementary sub-region $r_2(s_1,s_2) = [s_1-1,s_1]\times[s_2-1,s_2]$ a real valued random variable $X_{s_1,s_2}$ such that the array of random variables $\left(X_{s_1,s_2}\right)_{1\leq s_j\leq T_j}$ is independent and identically distributed.
